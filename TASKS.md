## ✅ Section 1: Completed Milestones

### 1. PowerShell Execution & Variable Preservation
- [x] **Unwrapper for Native PowerShell**: Fixed inner-quote stripping where `$downloads`, `$_`, and `foreach` loop variables were stripped into empty strings by nested `powershell -Command` wrappers.
- [x] **Trailing Quote Fix**: Refined `unwrapper` in `Parsers.ts` so path quotes like `"Get-ChildItem -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\Downloads\""` preserve internal quotes accurately.
- [x] **Native PowerShell Directives**: Updated `main.Instructions.ts` to enforce writing native PowerShell cmdlets directly without nested wrappers.

### 2. Terminal Noise & ANSI Escape Sequence Cleaning
- [x] **Cursor Position Jump Translation**: Replaced ConPTY row-repositioning escape codes (`\x1b[\d+;\d+[Hhf]`) with line breaks (`\n`) so table columns and output lines do not get squished together.
- [x] **CSI & Private Mode Scrubbing**: Cleaned private modes (`\u001b[?9001h`, `\u001b[?25h`), erase sequences (`\u001b[65X`), and OSC titles across both C# `SanitizeTerminalOutput` and Node.js `cleanTerminalOutput`.
- [x] **Dual-Layer Architecture**: Applied terminal sanitization in both the C# agent output stream and the Node.js backend parser before saving to DB or sending to Gemini.

### 3. Agent Stability & WebSocket Communication
- [x] **Zero-Wait Local Agent Error Reporting**: Updated `WebSocketClientService.cs` so if an exception occurs during command execution, it dispatches an immediate failure `cmd_response` back to the cloud instead of hanging for 30s.
- [x] **Null-Safe Regex Execution**: Guarded `ExecuteServices.SanitizeTerminalOutput` with null propagation (`?.`) and fallback try-catch to prevent Hot-Reload Rude Edit crashes.
- [x] **Safe Catch Block in `RunAsync`**: Fallback to raw string output on execution errors to prevent secondary crashes.
- [x] **Background Task Completion Routing**: Implemented `waitForTaskCompletion(taskId, timeoutMs)` and `task_finished` resolution in `websocket.service.ts` so background tasks (>5s) report their final exit codes cleanly.

### 4. Continuous Process & Daemon Handling
- [x] **Daemon Non-Blocking Execution**: Fixed the infinite-wait blunder in `Parsers.ts` where continuous/daemon processes (e.g. `ping -t`, dev servers) blocked the chat turn for 300s. Daemons now return immediately with their `taskId` so the AI can report status.
- [x] **Generalized Lifecycle Instructions**: Updated `main.Instructions.ts` to instruct the AI on evaluating command lifecycle (finite vs. continuous background services) rather than hardcoded rules.

### 5. UI Polish & Packaging
- [x] **Execution HUD Typography Scaling**: Scaled typography in `ExecutionsStep.tsx` (badges `text-xs`, counters `text-[11px]`, terminal output `text-[11px]`, action titles `text-xs`) and stripped verbose divider banner comments from `ExecutionsStep.tsx` and `ChatUI.tsx`.
- [x] **Single-File Standalone Release**: Compiled standalone self-contained binary `Local-BE-v2/dist/nexus.exe` (47.16 MB) via `build-agent.ps1` and deployed to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Nexus\nexus.exe`.

## 🎯 Section 2: Active & Immediate Goals

### Phase 1: Verified App Launching & Process Management (Current Priority)
- [ ] **Application Launch Verification (`launch_app`)**:
  - Add native verification in `Local-BE-v2` (`ExecuteServices.cs`): After starting a process or shortcut, wait up to 1.5s to confirm PID creation and main window handle existence.
  - Return structured verification: `{ "started": true, "pid": 1234, "processName": "Discord", "hasWindow": true }`.
  - Expose as first-class tool intercept or structured feedback so the AI knows with 100% certainty if the app actually opened.
- [ ] **First-Class Process Management (`kill_process` & `peek_processes`)**:
  - `peek_processes`: C# native method to query top CPU/RAM processes or search running processes by name/PID without heavy PowerShell startup overhead.
  - `kill_process`: First-class C# handler supporting both graceful (`CloseMainWindow`) and force-kill (`Kill(entireProcessTree: true)`) by PID or ProcessName.
  - Expose `kill_process` and `peek_processes` in `ParserTypes.ts`, `Parsers.ts`, and `main.Instructions.ts`.

### Phase 2: Live Terminals & UI Polish
- [ ] **Beautify Tool Output in `ExecutionsStep.tsx`**:
  - Replace raw JSON `<pre>` blocks for `search_app` and `memory_*` with responsive, styled cards (app icon, badges, file path, one-click copy).
- [ ] **Active Terminals Drawer / Sidebar UI**:
  - Add visual indicator badge (`Active Tasks: X / 4`) in the web sidebar.
  - Display list of background tasks (PID, command, elapsed uptime, status).
- [ ] **One-Click Task Termination**:
  - Add `[Kill]` button next to each running task in the web UI that dispatches `{ "type": "kill_task", "taskId": ..., "pid": ... }` to `Local-BE-v2`.

### Phase 3: Hardware Sensors & Elevation Polish
- [ ] **CPU Temperature / HVCI Blocklist Documentation & Workaround**:
  - Note root cause: `WinRing0x64.sys` used by LibreHardwareMonitor is blocked by Windows Code Integrity / HVCI driver blocklist on Windows 11.
  - Provide fallback / user toggle guide for Core Isolation Vulnerable Driver Blocklist or investigate alternative WMI / vendor SDKs for AMD Ryzen SMU temps.
- [ ] **UAC Elevation Refinement**:
  - Distinguish read-only commands (`--version`, `--status`) from elevated commands (`--install`, `--service`).
  - Eliminate flashing UAC windows when run from non-elevated prompts; display clean console notice: `"[!] Error: This command requires Administrator privileges."`

## 🔭 Section 3: Feature Backlog & Future Roadmap

### 1. Active Target Device Selection (Multi-PC Management)
- [ ] **Sidebar Radio Selector**:
  - Add device selection radio buttons in `SideBar.tsx` when a user has multiple linked PCs ("Gaming Desktop", "Work Laptop").
- [ ] **Targeted Dispatch in Gateway**:
  - Pass `activeDeviceId` in `sendCmdRequest` so commands execute only on the selected machine instead of broadcasting.

### 2. Zero-Trust Device PIN / 2FA Security
- [ ] **Physical Machine PIN Setup**:
  - Allow defining a 6-digit unlock PIN during local companion setup (`localhost:4100`).
  - Store bcrypt hash in MongoDB (`deviceSecretHash`).
- [ ] **Web Unlock Challenge**:
  - Require PIN verification before unlocking remote shell execution on that device.

### 3. Chromium Browser Companion Extension
- [ ] **Native Tab & Media Control**:
  - Connect browser extension to `Local-BE-v2` via local WebSocket (`ws://localhost:4100/extension`).
  - Provide surgical tab management (close specific tabs without killing browser process).
  - Extract live DOM / web page text for AI research.
  - Control YouTube / media playback directly.

### 4. Remote Mobile Companion (`nexus_app_v2`)
- [ ] Sync chat sessions, live execution steps, and task management with the React Native / Expo mobile app.
- [ ] Biometric confirmation (FaceID / Fingerprint) before executing high-risk system commands remotely.
